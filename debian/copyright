   2. You may modify your copy of the software in any way, provided that
      you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
        a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise
           make them Freely Available, such as by posting said

           the author to include your modifications in the software.
 .
        b) use the modified software only within your corporation or
           organization.
 .
        c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
           with standard executables, which must also be provided.

        d) make other distribution arrangements with the author.
 .
   3. You may distribute the software in object code or executable
      form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
